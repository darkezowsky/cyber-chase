<h1>Cyber-Chase</h1>
This was my very first solo project, created back in 2018 using Unity.
It started as a personal learning challenge, built from a mix of tutorials and study materials.

Set in a retrofuturistic world inspired by synthwave, vaporwave, and 80s VHS aesthetics,
Cyber-Chase is a simple arcade-style game where the player must outrun the police through neon-lit streets.

The purpose of this archive is to preserve and maintain the first functional game I ever made in a playable state on a modern version of the Unity engine.

Main goals of this repository:
* **Preserving the project as a milestone of my early development journey.
* **Keeping the game functional on newer versions of Unity.
* **Maintaining retro visual style and original synthwave mood.
* **Fixing small bugs and making light adjustments for smoother gameplay.
